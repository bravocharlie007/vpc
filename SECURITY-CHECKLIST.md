# Security Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Verification

### ‚úÖ VPC Workspace (This Repository)
- [x] AWS Provider updated to v5.70+ (from v4.0.0)
- [x] Removed commented credential references
- [x] KMS encryption enabled for all SSM parameters
- [x] Proper public/private subnet separation implemented
- [x] NAT Gateway added for secure private subnet internet access
- [x] Security groups configured with least-privilege access
- [x] All resources properly tagged with security metadata
- [x] Configuration template (terraform.tfvars.example) provided

### üîç Post-Deployment Verification

**Network Security:**
```bash
# Verify private subnets route through NAT Gateway
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --region us-east-1 --filters "Name=tag:TYPE,Values=route-table"

# Verify NAT Gateway is in public subnet
aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --region us-east-1

# Check security group rules are restrictive
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region us-east-1 --filters "Name=group-name,Values=*ec2deployer*"
```

**Parameter Encryption:**
```bash
# Verify SSM parameters are encrypted
aws ssm describe-parameters --region us-east-1 --filters "Key=Name,Values=/application/ec2deployer/"

# Test parameter decryption (requires appropriate permissions)
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/application/ec2deployer/dev/resource/terraform/vpc-id" --with-decryption
```

## Security Recommendations for Other Workspaces

### üîê Security Workspace
- [ ] Create least-privilege IAM roles for EC2 instances
- [ ] Set up cross-account IAM roles if using multiple AWS accounts
- [ ] Create KMS keys for EBS encryption
- [ ] Set up ACM certificates for HTTPS
- [ ] Configure AWS Secrets Manager for application secrets

### üíæ Database Workspace
- [ ] Enable RDS encryption at rest using KMS
- [ ] Configure RDS in private subnets only
- [ ] Set up automated encrypted backups
- [ ] Enable RDS Performance Insights
- [ ] Configure database parameter groups with security hardening
- [ ] Use RDS Proxy for connection pooling and IAM authentication

### üñ•Ô∏è Compute Workspace
- [ ] Deploy EC2 instances in private subnets only
- [ ] Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- [ ] Enable EBS encryption by default
- [ ] Configure ALB with HTTPS listeners only
- [ ] Implement WAF rules for web applications
- [ ] Use Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH
- [ ] Enable detailed CloudWatch monitoring
- [ ] Configure Auto Scaling groups with proper health checks

### üîç Monitoring Workspace
- [ ] Enable VPC Flow Logs for network analysis
- [ ] Set up CloudTrail for API audit logging
- [ ] Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
- [ ] Configure AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms for security events
- [ ] Create billing alerts for cost anomalies

## Security Monitoring Alerts

### Critical Alerts
- [ ] Unauthorized API calls (CloudTrail)
- [ ] Security group modifications
- [ ] Root account usage
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Unusual network traffic patterns (VPC Flow Logs)

### Cost Monitoring
- [ ] NAT Gateway data processing charges
- [ ] KMS key usage costs
- [ ] Unexpected EC2 instance launches
- [ ] High data transfer costs

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- [ ] Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for data handling
- [ ] Document data flows and retention policies
- [ ] Implement data encryption in transit and at rest
- [ ] Set up regular security assessments

### Access Control
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Regular access reviews and key rotation
- [ ] Principle of least privilege enforcement
- [ ] Segregation of duties for production environments

## Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Steps
1. **Identify**: Use CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and monitoring alerts
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected resources using security groups
3. **Investigate**: Analyze logs and determine impact scope
4. **Recover**: Restore from encrypted backups if needed
5. **Learn**: Update security controls and documentation

### Emergency Contacts
- [ ] Define security team contacts
- [ ] Set up automated alerting channels (Slack, PagerDuty)
- [ ] Document escalation procedures
